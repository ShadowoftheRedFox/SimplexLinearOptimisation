This is an academic tools created for [CY Tech](https://cytech.cyu.fr/). It is aimed to solve linear problems, mainly using the simplex method, showing various informations useful to illustrate the method or help students.

See the [documentation folder](documentation/) for more in depth explanations.

It is focused on being "student friendly", meaning the interface and the code documentation may be more deeply explained than necessary.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) which includes [Node Package Manager](http://npmjs.com).
- Install Java compatible with version 21.
- Install Maven compatible with Java version 21.

## Getting started

### Frontend

To install the frontend, you only need to type the commands below:

```shell
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install
ng serve
```

The line `npm install -g @angular/cli` will install the Angular CLI (Command Line Interface), that is able to launch, create and manage Angular projects from the terminal.
> [!TIP]
> The `-g` is to install if globally on your computer.

The line `npm install` will install all package specified in the [package.json file](/package.json).

If the project breaks after this command, used instead `npm ci`, which will force the NPM (Node Package Manager) to use the version provided in the [package-lock.json](/package-lock.json).

Finally, `ng serve` use the angular-cli to launch a local server on http://localhost:4200 (by default).

### Backend

```shell
cd ./backend/
# Manually
mvn install spring-boot:run
# Linux
./mvnw.sh install spring-boot:run
# Windows
./mvnw.cmd install spring-boot:run
```

The backend, the server running the different linear optimisation solver, is in the [backend folder](/backend/), which is why we use `cd ./backend/`.  
To launch the server, you can juste use the `mvn install spring-boot:run` command line. It will build and test the code, before launching the server.

The two other command lines are [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/), which is a utility that allows you to run Maven projects without needing a pre-installed Maven version.

### Initial Configuration

This project needs some informations, provided in multiples files:

- For the **frontend**, the [environments.ts](/src/environments/environment.ts) and [environment.development.ts](/src/environments/environment.development.ts) files are both configuration files. The first file is used when building the project (see [Building](#building)), the second is used when running the `ng serve` command above.  
Each fields needs to be present on **both files**, otherwise Angular will throw an error. 
- For the **backend**, [application.config](/backend/src/main/resources/application.config) is used as the configuration file.

Each fields has their own description, feel free to look at them.

## Developing

To start developing on the project, follow those steps:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShadowoftheRedFox/Simplex.git
cd simplex/
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the  `git` command is unknown, install [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) or download the code directly from GitHub.

The first line will pull the GitHub repository online and create a folder name "simplex", where all the files will be. Then the second line juste move your terminal into the newly created folder.

Then follow the [Getting started](#getting-started) section to setup the project.

The project should be running! Open in your internet browser http://localhost:4200, the project page, and try it out.

For further informations about the code itself, see [project-structure](/documentation/en/project-structure.md).

### Building

> [!WARNING]
> Unfinished section.  
> The project isn't buildable yet.
>
> In the future, the project should be able to run locally, by launching an executable.

## Features

> [!NOTE]
> Work in progress.

The main functionnality is, of course, to be able to solve an optimization problem using the simplex method.

In addition to this, the project can:
- Display graphically the feasible domain in 2D (and maybe in 3D).
- Display the tree of a branch and bound resolution.
- Display the steps to solve the integer simplex.
- Display the resolution using the interior-point method.
